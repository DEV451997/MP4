## Development Life Cycle

### Project Requirements

For my project, I‚Äôll be using the following technologies:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript: These are the building blocks for creating a user-friendly website.
* Python with Django: I‚Äôll be diving into Django to build the backend of my project.
* Relational Database: I will be using PostgreSQL for efficient data storage.

My project will contain the following:

* My project will have a robust backend powered by a relational database. This will allow users to store and manipulate data related to a specific domain.
* My project will be organized into multiple apps. Each app will handle a potentially reusable component. 
* I‚Äôll put some serious thought into designing my database schema. Relationships between entities will be carefully considered.
* I‚Äôll implement an authentication mechanism. Users will register and log in for a good reason‚Äîlike keeping their shopping cart intact between sessions.
* I‚Äôll create forms with validation. The Superuser can create and edit models in the backend. It‚Äôs all about making the user experience smooth.
* One of my Django apps will handle e-commerce functionality using Stripe. 
* My website will be well-organized, with clear navigation paths. No one wants to get lost in a digital maze!

### Data Handling

For my project, I opted for PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database. It allows me to efficiently store and manage structured data. With PostgreSQL, I can create tables, define relationships between them, and perform complex queries. It‚Äôs the backbone of my data storage, ensuring reliability and scalability.

### User Functionality

In my website, users have the power to explore the site. Here‚Äôs what they can do:

* Account Creation: Users can create their own accounts. A personalized corner of the site just for them, where they can view order history and update personal information for faster checkout.
* Log in/Log out: Once a user has created an account they can easily login and out at their own discretion.
* Basket: Logged-in users can add products to their baskets. 
* Stripe Checkout: Used for prompt payments.
* Contact Form: Any queries. Users or non-users have the ability to send an email with any questions they may have.

#### Project Superuser

The project Superuser has the ability to amend products and blog posts directly from the site. This has been carefully planned so only the superuser is able to CRUD. These features are hidden from shoppers.

### Structure

A well-structured layout is integral to the project's design. Main navigation is prevelant on all screen sizes. Thus allowing seamless navigation to all areas of the site. Whether a user logged in, a user who hasn't registered or the site admin. The site provides navigation to the sections relevant to the applicable user.

## Responsiveness

The site was tested on the following devices:
* Asus Vivobook Book Pro 16"
* Samsung S23 Ultra
* Samsung S20
* Acer Chromebook 14"
* Google Developer tools. Utilizing all dimensions including the responsive option.

## Deployment

### Step by step guide to deploying to Heroku
* I initiated the deployment process by creating a Heroku account.
* Prior to deployment, I prepared the project by creating essential configuration files. The requirements.txt file documented the project's dependencies, ensuring a seamless setup on Heroku. Additionally, the Procfile was crafted to specify the commands Heroku should execute to run the application.
* Navigating to the Heroku dashboard, I created a new application to serve as the deployment target.
* With the Heroku app in place, I connected it to my GitHub repository. This integration facilitated a streamlined deployment workflow, enabling automatic updates upon code changes.
* In the app's settings, I accessed the "Config Vars" section to securely manage environment variables. This step involved inputting sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, ensuring the secure functioning of the deployed application.
* I further enhanced the deployment process by configuring automatic deploys directly from my GitHub repository, by pushing requirements.txt and the Procfile.
* Each subsequent push to the branch, the application on Heroku updated, maintaining synchronization with the latest codebase.

### Issues/Solutions to coding problems.

1. Bag Refactor:

* During the process of refactoring the bag component for smaller screen sizes, I encountered a significant issue. While the refactor successfully resolved side-scrolling problems on mobile screens, it inadvertently introduced a functionality issue related to bag item decrements on larger screens.

* My initial attempt involved changing the quantity form IDs to classes and refactoring the JavaScript code accordingly. Unfortunately, this approach did not yield the desired results. Next, I implemented a custom quantity input script specifically for the bag app, but this also failed to address the issue.

* Seeking assistance from tutor support proved unfruitful, and my inquiries to classmates and group tutors via Slack went unanswered. Even after experimenting with additional adjustments, such as adding Bootstrap classes and applying CSS, the functionality issue persisted.

* Ultimately, I made an executive decision to prioritize functionality over visual perfection and retained the existing behavior, despite the remaining visual bug.

2. Connecting db.sqlite3 to ElephantSQL

* I Created a file named env.py in the root directory of my project. This is the file I defined my environment variables.
* Added env.py to gitignore to stop it pushing sensitive data to GitHub.
 
* At the top of the env.py  file, I imported os so I could set the environment variables in the operating system. Once I added the line ‚Äúimport os‚Äù underneath I assigned my environment variables using the following syntax: 
    * bos.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here" 
    * Example: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "ohsosecret" 
* Then the following code imports this new env.py file where I used my environment variables. 
* After adding this under your other imports at the top of the file: 
    * import os
    * if os.path.exists("env.py"):
    * import env 
* The if statement here is so that the env.py file is only pulled when working on your code in your workspace, not when it is deployed on heroku. 
* For deployment I set my environment variables in the heroku dashboard in settings > config vars.
* Now that my environment variables have been set in my env.py file, and the file has been imported into my project, I used them as needed using the following syntax: 
    * SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
* Next I ran migrations. 
* To transfer from db.sqlite3 to ElephantSQL I run backup:

    * python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > elephantsql.json 
    * commented out DATABASE_URL in env.py and ran
    * python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > sqlite.json
    * next I uncommented DATABASE_URL and ran
    * python3 manage.py loaddata sqlite.json which had a problem installing the fixture. To resolve this I reset my elephantSQL database.
    * Then I run python manage.py migrate then python3 manage.py loaddata sqlite.json

* Which led to another issue where I had to remove the admin logs from the json file to which I recieved Installed 43 object(s) from 1 fixture(s). Thus connecting my databases.

3. Testing Stripe
* When it came to testing Stripe. After setting it all up. Stripe provides a test card:
    * 4242 4242 4242 4242
* Any number can be used for:
    * MM/YY
    * CVC
    * ZIP
* Upon submitting payment I navigated over to Stripe where you can see payments have been succesful.

## Credits
* Credits go to Code Institute for providing a detailed walkthrough to Django and it's capabilities. Providing links to Django documentation to build and understand how a web application can easily be built, linking views, urls etc.
* I also used an online tutorial as the basis for the [Contact Form](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-email-contact-form-tutorial). This taught me how to set up the forms.py and link the relevant views and urls to create a contact form which, when submitted it succesfully shown to the terminal.
* For the [Blog] (https://realpython.com/build-a-blog-from-scratch-django/) I used this site as a reference. This gave me the basic structure and functionailty. I then expanded on the Blog using the products app adding Django features such as {{ post.content | linebreaks }} and {{ post.content|truncatewords:50 }} to aid readability and create a uniform layout. 
* Product images were created by using prompts via [Leonardo.Ai](https://leonardo.ai/). This allowed me to create copyright free imagery for my site.
