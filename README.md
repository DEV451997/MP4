## Deployment

### Step by step guide to deploying to Heroku
* I initiated the deployment process by creating a Heroku account.
* Prior to deployment, I prepared the project by creating essential configuration files. The requirements.txt file documented the project's dependencies, ensuring a seamless setup on Heroku. Additionally, the Procfile was crafted to specify the commands Heroku should execute to run the application.
* Navigating to the Heroku dashboard, I created a new application to serve as the deployment target.
* With the Heroku app in place, I connected it to my GitHub repository. This integration facilitated a streamlined deployment workflow, enabling automatic updates upon code changes.
* In the app's settings, I accessed the "Config Vars" section to securely manage environment variables. This step involved inputting sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, ensuring the secure functioning of the deployed application.
* I further enhanced the deployment process by configuring automatic deploys directly from my GitHub repository, by pushing requirements.txt and the Procfile.
* Each subsequent push to the branch, the application on Heroku updated, maintaining synchronization with the latest codebase.
